BURDShell: Installation of shell only
=====================================

IMPORTANT
---------
Some commands require 'admin/root priviledge in order to run.  
Ideally you should run the command as 'root' by either 


'sudo shell.php'
OR
run shell.php once you have 'sudo bash'

------------------

1) Extract and copy /BURDShell/ folder into /home/sysadmin/

2) Make shell.php executable

	cd /home/sysadmin/BURDShell
	chmod +x shell.php

2) Create symbolic link to shell command

	cd /usr/local/bin/
	ln -s /home/sysadmin/BURDShell/shell.php

3) Set up rlwrap, this allows for history and detecting 'backspace' and other control keys

	sudo apt-get install rlwrap
	
	//!!!IMPROTANT make sure you are 'sysadmin' and not 'root'!!!!!!
	cd ~
	vi .bash_aliases
		--Add the following line----
		alias shell.php='rlwrap -a shell.php'
		--Add the following line----		
	:wq

4)SVN port open [Optional] (WIP) Currently cannot commmit to server yet

	//Any one can acceess the repo
	sudo ufw allow 3690
