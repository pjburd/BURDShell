Switching networks [*nix]
=========================


There is 'Bridged' for allowing the virtual machine to be visible to other machines on the physical network.
	//Internet is visible
	
There is 'NAT' for virtual networking between virtual machine over a private network.
	// Internet is visible yet you share the /etc/host of your host machine (Ideal for testing).
	
There is 'Host only' is virtual networking between the host and and the machine only.
	//Internet is currently hidden

	

Private host networking
=======================
The virtual machine and host machine can only see each other.

	VIRTUAL MACHINE CLIENT
	----------------------	
		Make sure 'Network adaptor' is set to 'Host only'
		
	VIRTUAL MACHINE
	---------------
		Make sure /etc/network/interfaces file contains the following:
	
		--- Start of interfaces ---
		# The loopback network interface
		auto lo
		iface lo inet loopback
		
		# The primary network interface
		auto eth0
		iface eth0 inet dhcp
		--- End of interfaces ---
	
	BURSHELL commands: 
	------------------		
		1) network dynamic
		2) network status
		
		Note down eth0 IP and make sure your 'host machine' /etc/hosts' uses this IP for projects.
	
Restart server.
	
	
Private networking on local phsyiscal network
=============================================
Should you wish to share your development with other people on the local phsyical network.

This set up makes sure it is a static IP, so you don't need to worry about changing /etc/hosts files.

	VIRTUAL MACHINE CLIENT
	----------------------	
		Make sure 'Network adaptor' is set to 'Bridged Adaptor'


	VIRTUAL MACHINE
	---------------
		Make sure /etc/network/interfaces file contains the following:
	
		!!!! IMPORTANT!!!!!! 
		Make sure you select your desired static IP.
		Make sure you known your dns server.
	
		--- Start of interfaces ---

	    iface eth0 inet static
	    address 192.168.1.101
	    netmask 255.255.255.0
	    gateway 192.168.1.254
	    dns-nameservers 62.208.15.90 62.208.15.89

		--- End of interfaces ---

	BURSHELL commands: 
	------------------		
		1) network static
		2) network status


Restart server
