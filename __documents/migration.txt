Migrate BURDSHell versions
==========================
Steps to migrate between specific BURDSHell versions.

1.2b to 2.0.0
-------------
To upgrade your current BURDShell do the following
    
    1) Download the latest BURDShell and extract
    
    2) Open up the folder to your working directory for your version of BURDShell
    
    3) Rename the following folders to be 'OLD'
    
        rename __documents to be __documentsOLD
        rename BURDShell to be BURDShellOLD
    
    4) Copy over the latest folders

            BURDShell
            __documents
    
    5) Make sure shell.php is executable.
    
        cd /into/working/burderserver.dev/BURDShell
        chmod +x shell.php
        
    6) Test by running 'shell.php'
    

1.1.3b to 1.2b
--------------
[QUESTION] Why migrate with this version?
[ ANSWER ] 1.2b is more secure and no longer dependant on 'sudo'( sudo was able to reveal root password if not careful).

1)	Backup all known SVN projects managed by BURDSHell in 1.1.3b and lower

	sudo shell.php
	svn list
	backup svn [project]


2)	Rename old BURDSHell folder as we will be moving everything into a 'user' owned environment.  
    [NOTE]Some folders maybe 'root' owned so we need to 'sudo bash'.
				
		e.g. If burdserver.dev is stored here /home/sysadmin/burdserver.dev
		
			sudo bash
			cd /home/sysadmin/
			mv burdserver.dev burdserver.dev-old
	

2)	Unpack the burdserver.dev version 1.2b into your home folder
	[NOTE]This will be our new BURDSHell environment area.
	
		cd /home/sysadmin/
		tar -xvf burdserver.dev.tar.gz

	
3)	Migrate Apache2 sites (Owned by root to be user owned)
		[IMPORTANT] Do not 'sudo bash'.  Make sure you have exited out.
		
		For BURDSHell_Ubuntu			
	
			i) Find all sites managed under BURDSHell
			
				cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
				ls -l *dev
				
				
			ii) Disable all sites managed under BURDSHell found from step i)
							
				a2dissite [site.dev]
				
			iii) Restart webserver
			
				service apache2 reload
	
			vi) Copy all *.dev files in /etc/apache2/sites-avaiable/ into /path/to/burdserver.dev/vhosts
	
				cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
				ls -l *dev
				!!!!!MUST END WITH .conf  e.g. testsite.dev.conf       !!!!
				cp testsite.dev /home/sysadmin/burdserver.dev/vhosts/testsite.dev.conf
				

			v) Set up Apache2 config to use the 'vhosts' folder
		
				nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
				
				At the bottom of the file add the following
		
					Include /path/to/shell/vhosts/
					e.g.
						Include /home/sysadmin/burdserver.dev/vhosts/*.conf
						
			iv) Restart apache to use new location
				
					sudo service apache2 reload

				
4)		Migrate SVN projects owned by root (The only quick solution is restore each project)
		
		i) Copy your SVN backups into the new BURDShell v1.2b environemnt
		
			cp /path/to/svn/backups/* /home/sysadmin/burdserver.dev/backups
		
		ii) Either delete and restore OR change permissions of each each SVN project
		
			
			// Permission via Bash (You may need to sudo bash before doing the command
			sudo bash
			chown -R sysadmin /home/sysadmin/burdserver\.dev
			chgrp -R sysadmin /home/sysadmin/burdserver\.dev
			exit

			// Restore via BURDShell
			shell.php
			restore svn [project]
			
			
5)		Remove old history rlwrap (As it may have been 'root' owned)

			i) Verify .shell.php_history is not 'root' owned
				cd ~/
				ls -la .shell*
		
			ii) If 'root owned .shell.php_history then run the following
				For OSx
					sudo rm /Users/sysadmin/.shell.php_history
		
				For Ubuntu
					sudo rm /home/sysadmin/.shell.php_history
		
								
6)		BURDShell 1.2b should now fully owned by the user.

		[NOTE]You will see see warnings of failed admin calls 
		
			e.g. 'restart webserver' 
		
				[INFO] You must 'sudo' before running this shell command. e.g. 'sudo shell.php'
				[INFO] CMD was 'service apache2 reload'
				

			If you sudo bashed the shell then it will run fine.
			
		Feel more secure and happier with BURDSHell 1.2b
