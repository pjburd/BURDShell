OPTIONAL: Setup Virtual machine public broadcasting (EXPRIMENTAL)
=================================================================
IMPORTANT
---------
Before going futher, please understand 'switching-networks.txt' with your virtual machine client.

ABOUT
-----
BURDShell provides experimental network switching commands to allow projects to be visible to phsyical network.
	
	Known issues:
			Should you change to dynamic whilst in a foriegn network wifi you may need to restart the network 
			You may also need to change the network interfaces also.
			You may need to restart your virtual machine for the changes to take affect.

This setup assume you have the network setup.  
Should you wish to change physical networks, you need to change these accordingly.

			virtual machine IP: 192.168.1.101 as statuc
			YOUR dns servers  : 62.208.15.90 62.208.15.89

ENABLE NETWORK SWITCHING
------------------------
To enable support for switching network environments do the following

1) Copy the orignal network settings

    cd /etc/network/
    sudo cp interfaces interfaces.original
    sudo cp interfaces interfaces.dynamic
    sudo chmod 600 interfaces.original

2) Change eth0 to static

	a. sudo vi interfaces
			// Add the following
	    
	    iface eth0 inet static
	    address 192.168.1.101
	    netmask 255.255.255.0
	    gateway 192.168.1.254
	    dns-nameservers 62.208.15.90 62.208.15.89
	    
	b. Save and exit vi    
	    :wq
	    
3) Make a copy for future use
	
	sudo cp interfaces interfaces.static
    
4) Set up BURDShell into virtual machine mode

	a. Edit shell config 

		vi /path/to/shell/Config.php
	
	b. Set $virtual_machine to be TRUE.
	
	c. Save and exit vi
		
		:wq
	
5) You should now be able to use 'network static' and 'network dynamic'.

When changing network environments, you may need to restart the virtual machine.
