Troubleshoot
============

Compability support for Apache 2.4.3+
-------------------------------------
Edit the temlates/ 

	BURDShell/templates/apache2-virtualhost.txt
	BURDShell/templates/osx-apache2-virtualhost.txt

You will need to uncomment 'Require all granted' and save changes.

			# Uncomment this line if you are using "Apache 2.4.3"
			#                Require all granted

Network unreachable via ping or ssh
------------------------------------
The network setting on the virtual machine must be visible to other machines.
On VMWARE: Network Adaptor should be 'Bridged networking' set to  'auto detect' to pick up 'static' details(need to verify this).

Unauthorisd for SVN
-------------------
Make sure you have
	run shell command 'svn security' for the chosen site project.

Also if you have a firewall, make sure you have opened up port 3690 for SVN .

You see "sh: 0: getcwd() failed: No such file or directory"
-----------------------------------------------------------
You are running the shell.php within the working directory that has been deleted.
Exit the shell.php and change to another folder.
	
	e.g. #>cd /home/sysadmin/
		 #>shell.php
		  

Connection refused for svn client
----------------------------------
You recieve an error from your SVN client that it cannot find.

	svn: E000061: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn://burdserver.dev/home/sysadmin/svn/burdserver.dev/trunk'
	svn: E000061: Can't connect to host 'burdserver.dev': Connection refused


To resolve this, you need to start the SVN server but running the following BURDShell command:

	SHELL>svn serve
