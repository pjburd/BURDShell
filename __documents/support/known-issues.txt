[SECURITY]
Apache 2.4.3: Error

In error_log you recieve an error "client denied by server configuration".  This happens on Yosemite

For security reasons Apache added a new directive called 'Require all denied' and 'Require all granted' in Apache 2.4.3+
	
	<Directory "your directory here">
	   Order allow,deny
	   Allow from all
	   # New directive needed in Apache 2.4.3: 
	   Require all granted
	</Directory>

This version of BURDShell reflects this change in the following files.

	BURDShell/templates/apache2-virtualhost.txt
	BURDShell/templates/osx-apache2-virtualhost.txt

Uncomment the line if you are using Apache 2.4.3+
